# Passwords-R-Us
Here at Passwords-R-Us, we specialize in creating highly secure passwords that make it difficult for even the best of hackers to steal.  Hurry while supplies last.

## "One-in-millon chance of someone guessing your password?"
Not even close.  If you choose the maximum strength password we can generate, our random password generator technology makes the chances literally 1 in 1,467,574,951,244,021,123,655,345,106,016,837,380,110,615,560,179,184,677,679,415!!!  

A recently published study at "www.incrediblyuntruescience.bs" proved that hackers will actually lose their mind before they crack the passwords we generate. 

So sleep well because Passwords"R"Us is protecting your valuable data.

(Don't just take our word for it.  Reviews are pouring in, as noted on the Passwords-R-Us homepage.)

## Assignment (in all seriousness)

Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Special Efforts
- ran console.logs on core variables/arrays at several places during debugging to ensure values were setting properly
- Custom stylized the finished product by modifying html and css.
- Developed an entirely new brand of password generators and had the Chief Tech Editor at REALLY FAKE NEWS review the product; added quote to website to give it true credibility.
